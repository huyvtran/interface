# Contributing

Tivoli accepts contributions like any other project using git where you fork, branch, push and make a merge request.

If you don't know how this works, we recommend you look around online for a beginners guide. Here's a straightforward guide: https://jarv.is/notes/how-to-pull-request-fork-github

## Reporting bugs
